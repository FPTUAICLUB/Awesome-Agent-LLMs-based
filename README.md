# Awesome MultiAgent with LLMs based

Thanks to the impressive planning, reasoning, and tooling capabilities of the Large Language Model (LLM), people are actively researching and developing agents that support LLM. These agents can autonomously (and collaboratively) solve complex tasks or simulate human interactions.

Our goal with this project is to build a comprehensive collection of excellent resources related to the actors offered by the LLM, including papers, archives, and more. Not only that, we will try to summarize and note the important points of the articles. From there, it helps everyone have an overview of Agent based LLMs. We try to update this information regularly and continuously.
